This is the Moment of Love project. If you were sent this, it likely means that
the person who sent it to you loves you and wants to make that known. If you
stumbled upon this, I encourage you to go out and to use this now to tell
someone you love them. All you have to do is link them right to this page. Go 
on. Go ahead and do it. This page will still be here.

This project was conceived by web developer Aaron Weiss in an effort to help 
others express their appreciation for their loved ones. Sometimes, it's hard to 
tell someone you love them and other times, you simply forget to do so. The 
Moment of Love project wants to help remind you though. Do what you can and 
spread the love. Tell others how much you care about them. If everyone took a 
few moments to appreciate everyone they loved, the world would be a happier 
place. Thank you.

result, this whole site is, by nature, open source. However to provide an easy 
way of managing the code and any contributions to it, this site is hosted on
